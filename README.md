### Download
#### For Linux AppImage that run anywhere SOON...
### Reason
If your app plays audio/video you need to enable tauri.conf.json > tauri > bundle > appimage > bundleMediaFramework. This will increase the size of the AppImage bundle to include additional gstreamer files needed for media playback.
